# Global Neatness and Conciseness Standard

This document defines the global standard for strong, neat, and concise outputs across all development projects.

## Core Principles

### Strong
- Assertive, confident language
- No hedging or uncertainty ("might", "could", "perhaps")
- Direct statements of fact
- Clear action items

### Neat
- Consistent formatting
- Proper structure and hierarchy
- Clean spacing and alignment
- Professional presentation

### Concise
- Direct and to-the-point
- No unnecessary words
- One idea per sentence
- Maximum clarity with minimum words

## Documentation Standards

### Structure

```markdown
# Main Title (H1 - one per document)

## Section Title (H2 - major sections)

### Subsection (H3 - subsections)

#### Detail (H4 - rarely used)
```

**Rules:**
- One H1 per document
- Logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Consistent heading style
- Clear section separation

### Paragraphs

- **Length**: 2-4 sentences maximum
- **Focus**: One main idea per paragraph
- **Spacing**: One blank line between paragraphs
- **Width**: 80-100 characters per line for readability

### Lists

**Bullet points:**
- Use for unordered items
- Consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Parallel structure
- End with period if complete sentences

**Numbered lists:**
- Use for sequential steps
- Clear action verbs
- One action per item

### Code Blocks

```language
// Always specify language
// Use proper indentation
// Include relevant context only
```

**Rules:**
- Always specify language
- Include only necessary code
- Add comments for clarity
- Remove commented-out code

### Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data     | Data     | Data     |

**Rules:**
- Align columns properly
- Use consistent formatting
- Include headers
- Keep concise

## Language Standards

### Active Voice

✅ **Good**: "The system processes requests"
❌ **Bad**: "Requests are processed by the system"

### Direct Statements

✅ **Good**: "The API returns user data"
❌ **Bad**: "The API might return user data, or it could potentially..."

### Specific Terms

✅ **Good**: "Database connection failed"
❌ **Bad**: "Something went wrong with the database thing"

### Avoid Filler Words

Remove: basically, essentially, kind of, sort of, really, very, quite, rather, pretty much, etc.

✅ **Good**: "The service handles authentication"
❌ **Bad**: "The service basically handles authentication"

## Code Standards

### Comments

```typescript
// Explain why, not what
// Maximum 2-3 lines per block
// Use clear, concise language

// Bad: "This function does X"
// Good: "Validates user input before processing to prevent injection attacks"
```

### Naming

- **Descriptive but concise**: `getUserById` not `getUserByIdFromDatabase`
- **Follow conventions**: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes
- **Avoid abbreviations**: `calculateTotal` not `calcTot`

### Formatting

- Consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Clear function separation
- Logical grouping

## Communication Standards

### Issue Reports

**Format:**
```
Problem: [One sentence description]

Steps to Reproduce:
1. [Action]
2. [Action]
3. [Action]

Expected: [One sentence]
Actual: [One sentence]

Environment: [Concise details]
```

### Solution Documentation

**Format:**
```
Solution: [1-2 sentence summary]

Implementation:
1. [Step]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]

Verification:
- [ ] Check 1
- [ ] Check 2
```

### Error Messages

✅ **Good**: "Database connection timeout after 30 seconds"
❌ **Bad**: "Error occurred. Something might be wrong. Please check."

## Examples

### Before (Weak, Messy, Verbose)

```
So basically, the system kind of has this issue where it might not work
properly sometimes. You could try to fix it by doing a few things, like
maybe restarting the service or checking the logs. It's really important
to make sure everything is set up correctly, you know?
```

### After (Strong, Neat, Concise)

```
The system fails to process requests when the database connection times out.

Fix:
1. Restart the database service
2. Verify connection settings
3. Check network connectivity

Prevention: Configure connection pool limits in database settings.
```

## Enforcement

### Code Reviews

- Check for neatness and conciseness
- Reject verbose or unclear code
- Require formatting compliance

### Documentation Reviews

- Verify structure and formatting
- Check language clarity
- Ensure conciseness

### Automated Tools

- Prettier for code formatting
- ESLint for code quality
- Markdown linters for documentation
